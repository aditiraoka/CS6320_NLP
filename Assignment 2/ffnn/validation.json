The only 1 without dirty dishes was sticky. Still, we attempted to order coffee however, a large mocha & a small black coffee was apparently a brain teaser for the barista. Our simple order was messed up twice. We tried again, by ordering bread pudding French toast. Alas, this was again a big mistake. Not only was our food served cold, it came with no utensils. I was so embarrassed I spent the entire afternoon apologizing to my mom. I have never been back nor will I ever go back. PSA-There is a Tip Jar located at the register but beware, our very astute & creative barista automatically added a 15% gratuity to our bill.

The lady really lacked experience, she really didn't know what she was doing... She didn't even know how to use the tweezers needed to place the extension on my existing lash..... They kept dropping on my face... She quickly gave up using the tweezers to apply the lash and surprisingly, she started applying the lashes WITH HER OWN FINGERS. She was struggling tremendously, dropping the lashes on my face almost every time. At that point I started to really regret my decision.\n\nNot to mention that she was pulling out my own eyelashes with tweezers. This is a NO NO! Every lash technician should know that this pulls out your natural lashes leaving bald spots on your lash line... I now have to use a lash serum so that hopefully my natural lashes can grow back. Remover gel is suppose to be applied before removing eye lash extensions. I even told her to stop because it pulls out my natural lash but she continued.\n\n\nThen end result was horrible.

I was shown how to hook up my phone to the vehicle, but only because I openly asked. There was never any time spent to go over what all the dials and knobs did and I have been forced to teach myself. This is all the more frustrating when I was open to come back the next day, but the salesman was dead set on finishing the deal then shorted me because he \"stayed late.\"\nThe bigger frustration came the next day. The initial night I got home late, so did not spend much time reorganizing my vehicle. The next day when I had some time, I realized that the inside was dirty although I was told it was recently detailed, as it was a service loaner. Dust. Dirt on the seats. Personal papers in the glove box. Also a dirty napkin and Combo (yes, the pretzel/cheese snack) on the carpet between seats. Again, car buying is frustrating to begin with, but being actively lied to is absurd.\nAgain, I am happy with my new vehicle, but utterly disappointed with the service I received. The salesman also had the gall to tell me that I will get a survey from Chevrolet to grade his performance and that he does not get a bonus if the highest marks are not given. I can safely say he will not be getting his bonus. Would not come here again for another vehicle, which hopefully isn't coming any time soon, and if asked would inform others to steer clear.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "What a disappointment!

The fish was dry, and two of the pieces tasted off. \n\n* Miso soup was hot, but was salty broth, not one piece of seaweed or tofu to be found.\n\n* The soggy lettuce salad was neither cold nor crisp.\n\n* The tea would not even qualify as lukewarm.

He struggled with my dresser and several times, I instinctually stepped toward him because it looked like he was going to fall and/or drop the dresser completely. He \"rested\" the dresser on a stair while they tried to get it up the stairwell. These \"rests\" caused several punctures in the back of the dresser because it was banging into the top of the landing banister each time. \n\nAt the end of the move, I sat down with the guy who was in charge and gave him the necessary information for the damage claim. After this was done, another guy started to fill out the rest of the paperwork and add up the time and cost for the job. This took several minutes and he did all of the calculations without a calculator and had to review the numbers several times. He then told us we were being charged for an additional 15 minutes because the move was estimated for 3 hours (9:30am - 12:30pm) and he did not finish the paperwork until 12:32pm. \n\nAfter the paperwork was done, they returned to the truck and I walked upstairs to further inspect my dresser and saw that the boxspring that was supposed to be on the bed was in the wrong room and the other boxspring was resting against a dresser and the mattress resting against the wall. I moved the boxspring into the correct room and placed the mattress on the boxspring and then noticed a block of wood (part of the bed frame) sitting on the floor. I ran outside and luckily the truck was still there and asked them to return to finish putting together the frame.

This company practices terrible money rip off policies! I recently needed a plumber to repair a leak that was causing problems. When arriving the plumber that was sent, told me that there would be a minimum charge of $275.00 to find the leak, but that the charge could be applied to any work that needed to be done. I thought that was a bit high, but since I needed the repair done, I agreed. I also thought they must use this practice to ensure that they didn't spend alot of time in discovering a leak only to be told that a customer didn't want the repair done. After 10 minutes, he discovered the leak was coming from a faucet in the master bathroom sink. However, the faucet was located inside a wall that was covered by a mirror mounted to the wall from the countertop to the ceiling. He told me that I'd have to get someone in to remove the mirror. I understood and agreed. At that point he gave me an invoice for the $275.00 he quoted. I asked if this payment would apply to the repair that needed to be done after the mirror was removed and he told me no! That would only apply to work done the same day. I was furious! $275.00 for a total of 30 minutes spent in my home and no work completed. \nI had the mirror removed, and had them back to do the repair, only to have them come a second time and now inform me that the faucet component that was inside the wall should be replaced. So he left and told me that he would include the bill for that day when he came back to replace the faucet after I went to a supply house and found the part needed. After finding the necessary part, I considered using a different company, but I figured that I was in this far with Epic, I may as well let them finish. The same plumber came back and replaced the faucet body. The work took about 45 minutes. He then presented a bill for $500.00!!! He told me that the exorbitant charge was what they normally get just for the faucet replacement, but he actually discounted that to $350.00 and then $150.00 for the prior days to tell me to get a new faucet. \nI hate to be taken advantage of in situations like this but I paid him the $500.00.

Every time she came to the table she had some excuse as to why something took so long or wasn't right and always had someone else to blame.  I hate when servers complain all the time.  Before our food came we ordered a blue moon, Rebecca told us she would get it after she got all the other drinks she needed to get for other customers, as if we were being a nuisance.  We got our food which was luke warm so probably had been ready for a while, then had to request silverware from another server.  Still waiting on a beer.  Ate all our food, still waiting on our beer.  Cleaned up our plates, still waiting on our beer.  Eventually Rebecca came up to our table and placed the receipt on the edge without asking if we needed anything else and said \"oh did you still want that blue moon\"  we told her no and she said \"I didn't think so\" and walked away.

I rarely if ever post reviews on Google, however, if I could prevent just one person from renting from this company or hiring them for their rental management services, then this review is worth my time. Considering one of the (3) five star reviews on Google is literally from this company's Manager raving about how wonderful it is to work for this company and how \"exceptional\" their customer service is, I felt obliged to writing a review from the tenant's perspective. In response to the Managers comment about it being hard to please everyone; yes, very much so. However, I believe I speak for everyone in this review thread when I say, the customer service is unfathomably awful.  These problems are not matters of \"people pleasing\" but tenants respectfully requesting to have working appliances within a reasonable time frame, and decent customer service if anything at all and this company is light years away from that. I simply cannot associate bad customer service with \"protecting the client's investment,\" or \"putting the client's first.\"\n\nAside from the tasteless comments that were given from their staff, our service requests were closed out, ignored and other services requests were looked at by their \"repair man\" who did essentially nothing to fix the problem. At the beginning of our lease we went months without a working washer. When we decided to request a deduction on rent for the time gone without a working washer from our property manager Kim, she bantered back and forth with me saying we did not have a right to a reduction on our rent, referencing that we could easily take our laundry to a laundromat. Our leaking air conditioner also went about 2 months without being fixed, and my cousin slipped and fell injuring his back. Eventually after speaking with the head manager Mike Gross and threatening to gain legal counsel we received a slight deduction in rent for the month.  Regardless, it was a situation that was handled poorly from the very start. It is outrageous to think that even after my cousin injured his back because of a service request going ignored; our property manager not only regretted to give us a simple apology but instead became rude and disrespectful. If that's not terrible customer service, I don't know what is.  \n\nFortunately, we will no longer be continuing our lease with this company, I informed the landlord that although we love her unit, and although she is a wonderful person, we will not accept dealing with an awful company like Property Management Solutions or \"Entrust Reality\". In addition, I received an email today about charges being posted on our lease, meanwhile they have chosen to deactivate our account, further (attempting) to hinder us from retrieving proof of past work orders, and problems. \n\nMy cousin and I are reasonable people and have had our fair share of jobs working in customer service fields.

They have a sports-centre in the back of the bar area with reclining leather chairs and wall-to-wall screens. They have a few private dining areas which are really nice, and their booths all have private TVs. They have a great, convenient location, and have a really full menu that has something for everyone. \n\nSo why don't I love it? Well I'm extremely partial to sliders, and upon my first visit there I was so happy to see that they have tons of slider options. The first time I ordered them, it was St. Patrick's Day, and it was insanely busy. They got my order wrong the first time, but quickly changed it. However, when I did get my sliders, they were cold! So disappointing, but I decided to give them another chance, since it was so busy that evening. Maybe a week later I went back to try the Chicken Wing Sliders... unfortunately, they got my order wrong again... but this time I was in a rush and just ate the sliders. They were good, not great. The main issue I have with them is that they have a \"wonder-bread\" type bun. Just empty white-bread carbs that basically taste like nothing-ness - and if you're paying around $15 for sliders, I would hope to have something a bit better!

Our first choice was cheesy potatoes, but as often is the case mentioned in other reviews, they were out of something.  Overall I will say the menu is pretty limited, and you shouldn't expect to find the variety you would find at a Rudys, or Honey Bears.  As for the food, put it this way.  We ended up throwing most of everything out and going to plan B.  The positive was the lean quality of the pulled pork.  That's where it ends however.  The meat had absolutely no flavor, the store bought hamburger rolls they give you tasted stale, the BBQ sauce tasted only like ketchup, the beans had no flavor or texture, and the slaw was dry and loaded with ground pepper.  I rate \"Got Que? \" a two out of five based on the lean quality of the pork and friendly staff.  Overall however I just literally throw $25 in the trash, and just don't see a reason to return.

And so expectations were high...maybe too high.\n\nI had made reservations a month prior since we had cousins coming into town joining us for dinner & a concert later.\n\nWe arrived and the place was not that busy for a Sunday evening.  But right after us people started coming in and it filled up.\n\nWe enjoyed reviewing the menu selections and ended up ordering quite a feast which included 2 charcuterie boards and another 6 tapas.  Initially the waitress was a little pushy trying to get us to place an order and hovering (nothing like feeling pressure) and when I finally ordered the wine for the table she seemed slightly taken aback that I ordered the wine instead of the menfolk (I worked in the biz 20yrs ago and I know wine, so really who cares who orders).  Our cousin (the other lady in the group) ordered a flight of wine tasters and was waiting for the charcuterie to arrive so she could enjoy some of the cheese with her wine.  45 minutes later we finally had to enquire as to where are meal was since we had a concert to go to in an hour.\n\nWhat we were \"told\" was there was a large group in the house and only 2 in the kitchen.  What we \"heard\" was we didn't properly staff our restaurant for this evening and so all the customers food will take a long time.  Seriously a charcuterie board taking 60 minutes??  10 minutes later it finally arrived.  It was certainly delicious but the wine flight had long been consumed by this time.  5 minutes later the tapas started arriving and of course we were running late so everything was eaten hastily and we can't help but wonder prepared this way also.  The BC Seared Scallops were gritty although the broth was tasty.  The Eggplant Chips were missing the eggplant and all you could taste was the crispy coating.  The Falafels were doughy inside.  The Flight & Bite with Lamb Stew was good.  The Artic Char was good....the Lobster Nachos had a nice flavour but seemed to be missing lobster (3 pieces is all we could find).   Finally the Flank steak arrived and made hubs happy.  Cooked to perfection.  Even more delightful were the accompanying cooked winter greens.  Holy deliciousness...everyone agreed and we chowed down on those delectable greens like hungry little rabbits.\n\nDuring our meal we asked for the wine menu again since the cousin with the empty wine flight had not been asked if she wanted anything further to drink.  For a waitress who was hovering at the beginning we had to battle to get and keep her attention now.  Our cousin was drinking white and asking for suggestions.  She was given a recommendation by the waitress who then turned to leave without addressing any of the rest of us.  We called her back...since we also wanted to order more wine.  Wow does body language speak volumes and we felt like we were imposing on our waitress.  I ordered 2 more wine tasters for hubs & myself.  Then the waitress turned to run away again not even addressing the white wine drinker who was also ready to order.  We called her back YET again and uneasily felt like we were still bothering her.  Since we were already late for the concert we had no time for dessert or an after dinner beverage.\n\nWe spent a lot of money for a mediocre evening and left slightly disappointed by the overall experience.  The cousins advised they enjoyed the company and some of the food/wine but this would not be there first choice again.  As for us I am hoping it was just bad planning and a bad night for the restaurant unfortunately at our expense.

Initially it wasn't busy. By the time I finished my meal, they were jumping. I don't know my servers name, however she (a younger female) was knowledgeable and pleasant. My meal which consisted of pho, and crispy spring rolls, which is my favorite. There is usually a gentleman at the register, but I didn't see him today. I wanted to thank him for his suggestiions of my take out lunch the last time I was in. It was a hit!  OK that's it for the pleasantries. There was a little short grumpy women, who has never waited on me before. My bill was $17 and I left a $3 tip on the table. When I stopped at the cashier to pay my bill, the little short grumpy women asked me if I had cash. I said \"sorry, I don't have anymore cash on me\" The little short grumpy women, then rang everything and applied the balance to my debit card. I still had to sign my receipt. When I handed it back to her, she turned the receipt toward me and asked \"No tip!\"? I looked at her a little confused at first, but replied \"I left it on the table\". Now my blood pressure is rising, and I wanted to say a few things to her, for insulting me. I decided Yelp would be a better way to go. She also reprimanded a young man (I believe he's new) in their language about the number of place settings on the table. I don't know his name either, but he wore black framed glasses and worked the room with the younger female server. You could tell by the expression on his face, that he was a little embarrassed, since she yeld across the room. \n\nWell the little short grumpy older woman ruined my lunch. I thought about her condescending remark to me all the way home. Hopefully she is not the owner, because she should be a bus person only. This same little short grumpy older women borrowed the hot sauce from my table. She didn't ask, but she did say hello as a distraction while she had to reach pass  me to get it.When the little short grumpy older women retuned the hot sauce it literally was a drive-by. It startled me to see the hot sauce sliding across my table like a baseball player sliding into home plate. She never broke her stride, and never looked back.\n\nI've been eating lunch/early dinner here since 2004, and as much as I really love the food, I haven't decided if I will ever go back.

Looking around the place, I felt really old here. The place seems to cater to the younger crowd even at 8pm.  \n\nThe bar was busy. It was about 10 minutes before someone even acknowledged me.  Then I asked what their beers were and she explained them (little did I know that the menu she would hand me in a few minutes would contain a list of their beers).  Thankfully they have a bunch of craft beers on tap.  \n\nThe food menu is small and consists of apps (think chips with salsa, queso or guac), salads, tacos and such but your choices are limited for all of them.\n\nI went with the recommendation from another review of the queso with everything except chorizo for an app and 2 tacos rojas which were all vegetarian.  Another disappointment when both arrived at the same time.  The queso was mediocre at best.  It was very grainy and the extras of black beans and jalapenos were on top of a cheese crust rather than mixed in the queso.\n\nThe tacos were decent but nothing i would consider better than average.\n\nService is what caused this to be a 2 star review rather than a 3. Although there were 3 bartenders, only one seemed to be 'my' bartender but she disappeared and I didn't see her after one \"Are you ok here\".   Another bartender asked me if I wanted another beer but that was it...at that point I was ready to close my bill.  The 3rd one asked again if I needed another beer and I stated I was done and finally I received a check.

I cannot see myself coming back here until something changes.", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "13th Floor is part of a haunted house \"franchise\" that has a couple of other locations; the one in Denver is where it all started, and is a legend unto itself. If you visit the Denver website, you can view videos about the house, and you will see repeatedly that USA Today included 13th Floor in their list of \"Top 13 Haunted Houses in America.\"\n\nThe Arizona incarnation leaves something to be desired. Located in a rented-out strip mall in a seedy part of Bell Avenue, 13th Floor does not impress you from the get-go. What you do notice right away is the crowd of hundreds of people lined up to get inside and get spooked. I took this as a good sign, even though we showed up half an hour after they opened. \n\nBuy your tickets online if you can. There is a line of hundreds to get in the house, and a similar line for tickets as well. If you're a patient person, and you want some time to build up the anticipation and adrenaline by being surrounded by a ton of giddy and jumpy people, go for the lines. They have actors with chainsaws and creepy makeup pacing around, scaring the easy targets, posing for pictures, and giving you a preview of what's to come. \n\nThe actual haunted house is nothing special. If you've been to one before, you'll see it all again. You have actors in creepy makeup and clothing jumping out at you, slamming things against the wall or floor, and getting up in your face. There are rooms you're led through themed as grisly, defiled homes, kitchens, and hallways; there was a pirate-themed area, and a misty jungle to walk through. I was disappointed in the lack of jumps in that area; the scare potential among the close-pressing fog, bushes, and trees was great. (I wish I had been able to go through more slowly to admire the props and background setup; everything was something you've seen before, but it was beautifully set up. 13th Floor may not have scared me, but they get points for attention to detail.) \n\nOne thing that I'll admit I've never seen before was the usage of partially closed garage doors placed in strategic areas. Open only a foot or two from the floor, an actor would get a running start and slide on his knees out from under the door and then pop up next to you. The first time or two I saw this, it was downright hilarious; this does not seem to be an easy or very practiced thing for the actors to do, and some of them ate it or slammed into my legs like they were trying to take me out. (The actors are not supposed to/allowed to touch you.)\n\nI will admit that I'm not an easy person to scare. I'm not jumpy or unnerved by the dark, loud sounds, or people lunging at my face suddenly. (When you take care of a toddler all day, you develop a sort of Clint Eastwood hardness and eventually lose your flinching reflex.) There were, however, people all around me screaming their heads off in terror. One girl was even sobbing. If that isn't a testament to 13th Floor's fear factor, I don't know what is. \n\nThe fatal flaw of my visit was the fact that the event staff was not separating the groups for long enough time periods. Things cease to be scary when you're basically part of a continuous shuffling line of people. You're rushed, and you can see ahead of you what's about to pop out of that dark corner, because you just watched the group ahead of you deal with it. Our total time going through the house was 13 minutes. (Yes, I timed it.) \nWe paid $35 per person to get a VIP ticket, which gives you access to a much shorter line; regular admission is $25. Had I paid half that amount, I would have written this off as an unusual, fun activity to try out on a Saturday night. However, losing nearly forty bucks on this snooze stings. \n\nIf our group of 4 was alone, hearing only the distant screams of other people ahead of us, then I could up 13th Floor another star, rating it as A-Okay. As it stands now, however, my experience was thoroughly 2-star.", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "Moe's is like the Subway of fast food burrito joints.

The pretzel brioche and whipped butters were good, but no one ever told us what the butters were.  We figured out one was mustard, one honey, and the one in the middle was a mystery butter.  There were very few pickles on our plate (one slice of jalapeno for example) and we had to ask for more bread.  In addition, I didn't like two of the three cheeses that were served, and I can't say that has ever happened to me before.  Our friends ordered two entrees to share, scallops and lamb, and the server left before taking the order for the other half of the table.  We had to call our server back to order.  My boyfriend and I shared the sticky pork shank and sides of brussel sprouts and crispy fingerling potatoes.  I enjoyed the pork shank more than my boyfriend did and the brussel sprouts were not crispy like I would have preferred.  All in all, we could have prepared a better version of this meal at home.\n\nIf the food was amazing and the service lackluster, I may have been able to overlook the deficits of this restaurant.  However, when a shared meal costs over a hundred dollars (in Charlotte no less), I expect the food to wow me and the service to be up to standard.

I called to complain but the wait times on the phone were too long.  It didn't matter if we called the front desk or room service we were on hold for too long every time.

Coupled with another truck that we wanted to try, we talked about it for weeks! Keep in mind that I write these reviews not just to help the customers be wise consumers, but also so that business owners can get feedback from customers and gain insight into running their business in the most successful manner. With that said, I struggle with this review. The company has really been well marketed and over hyped! The truck is beautiful and as up to date as possible. The line was extremely long and it took quite a while for food to come out. While waiting in line I noticed that several people were complaining and returning food! I was honestly pretty worried at that point and tried to hear why they were coming back. The complaints were all the same. The lobster rolls they had ordered were supposed to be hot and that the lobster was cold. I asked one lady what was wrong with her food and she told me that it was ice cold in the middle. People were not complaining about the line to order. They were complaining about the wait for their food. There was a huge group of people waiting for food. Suddenly a woman appeared frantically trying to get into the truck's front door which was locked. She had Walmart bags in her arms. I said to my wife that she must have made a Walmart run for Lobster (We were in the parking lot for Sam's Club and next to the Walmart.) I was joking but I think she went to get bread. That's right my \"roll\" was on bread. I would say it was Texas Toast to be exact. So, it was my turn to order. The guy is taking orders from the window which is quite high, and I had trouble hearing him. He used a tablet to have me sign for my debit card. They ask for an optional tip which I find absurd when no one is doing anything worth tipping. They didn't bring my food and as a matter of fact I had to ask for a napkin and a fork. When I went back to get a knife the lady was very nice, but I still wouldn't say it was worthy of even more money. I must admit that I was taken back by the price. I know that lobster can be expensive, but this is extremely expensive for the size of roll you get. It is about double what I think it is worth. Our order did not take too long to get (about 8 minutes). I guess once the cook came back it was easier to pump out food. By the way I watched to see if she washed her hands and she did.  The man called our name over the loud speaker that is useless! I didn't see anyone else go to the window, so I figured it must be mine. Anyway, we got our food and I was shocked at how small it was. My wife and I always split food. I could eat three of these on my own! We each took our two bites and the Lobster is wonderful. It has a wonderful sweet flavor. There was a small line of mayo on the Texas toast that did not make much difference. I would double the mayo but that is me. It was lobster on bread. Well the wait was over and in two bites the meal was over. I looked at my wife and laughed. I said, \"well that was a big bubble buster!\" She said she thought the flavor was great but that the $20 we spent was not worth it. For the record the roll was $16.50 plus tax and tip. I felt a little robbed to be honest. I am the type of person that tips huge amounts for great service and doesn't mind paying a lot of money for quality food and service. In this case it was a bit much. Let's not forget this is a food truck. They don't even have the overhead of a brick and mortar restaurant! They must be making a killing off the name and notoriety, but it will not last for long because I can't imagine too many people will go twice. I know that I would never do it again.

They love Kabuki back from when they lived in So Cal. I wanted to treat them to a nice NYE meal, so we made reservations here, which were available on Open Table at 815, 830, and 845.\n\nOur reservations were for 815 but we were running 15 min late so I called ahead. I was assured it was no problem, though was also advised that they had \"last call\" for both food and drink at 845, which seemed odd since their last res was for 845. \n\nUpon our arrival, the hostess looked a bit put out and reminded us of the 845 \"last call\", but also assured us that we were welcome to stay in the restaurant as long as we liked so as to not feel rushed. We were quickly able to give our drink order and our server came by about 5 minutes later. We had to very quickly decide what our entire order would consist of, including all sushi/rolls, etc. This turned out fine, but I didn't appreciate having to order everything up front.\n\nOur server was polite, but it quickly became quite obvious that the restaurant staff were closing the restaurant down, to the degree that 15 minutes after having our food, our server was coming to get our soy sauce bottle \"out of the way\" - to which I objected as we were obviously still in the middle of dinner. He then dropped the bill off a very short time later. Having felt rushed from the moment we entered the restaurant, I asked to speak with the manager. She assured we could stay \"as long as we liked\", though didn't so much as offer any apology for our treatment - quite frankly, she was probably directing them to close as quickly as possible.\n\nThe 2-stars was because the food was quite good, otherwise it would've been one star.

Despite having three servers working five tables, it took about 15 minutes to get our drinks and a small complimentary basket of chips.   Did I mention that the basket of chip was small?  Our party of four devoured them in three minutes, but no one came by to ask us if we wanted more.  (It should be noted that the first basket of chips was free, after that, you'll be charged $2 for a bottomless supply).  The chips were the star of the evening.  Hot, fresh with plenty of crunch.  I would make the trip to the west side just to get another fix.  The consistency of the salsa verde was a disappointment.  It was far too watery, making it difficult to get the right balance of salsa and chip.\n\nI also enjoyed the Quesadillas de Rajas y Queso we ordered as an appetizer.  The corn masa coating was cooked to perfection, but I would have preferred a Mexican cheese over the mozzarella used as the filling.  The roasted poblanos were excellent and a small serving of crema was a welcome addition to the dish.\n\nAfter a long wait (about 20 minutes) and only one refill of our basket of chips, we received the entrees.  I ordered one of the specials, a beef barbacoa based on the recommendation of the server.  The beef was tender, but a little under seasoned.  The dish was overpowered by a pile of raw onions that topped the beef.  I like onions, but these gave the dish a sulphery aftertaste.  The sides also were disappointing, the re-fried beans were overcooked and lacked texture, the Mexican rice was mushy and bland.  With the little more focus on the details, this could have been a great meal.\n\nThe kids ordered cheese enchiladas and chicken enchiladas. The salsa verde lacked punch.  The tomatillos really needed to be roasted longer to give the green sauce more depth.

There are some great Mexican melting cheeses that could have vastly improved this dish.\n\nAfter another long wait, we finally received the bill which totaled $65 before tip for our group of four.

I think the owners need to focus more on getting the customers substance in their food. For example, we ordered the cheese platter ($14). The platter came with 3 small pieces of toasted bread, scattered walnut bits that no one know what to do with, a few jumbo olives, and some standard cheeses. We asked for more toasted bread and about 10 minutes later, we got 4 more pieces. There were 5 of us - An appetizer that is over $9 should be able to feed more than 3 people.   They were also out of anything pretzel which was a letdown (understandable since this is still a new business). \n\nMy pizza was pretty amazing though! All of the pizzas sounded delicious - the ingredients were very fresh. Something that was off was that each additional topping was $2?? It's just not worth it here. It's really not. The rest of the table ordered sandwiches. Synopsis, nothing to write home about. The chips they give you on the side seemed like they were from a bag. The ones my boyfriend got seemed like they came from the bottom of the bag. When everyone was done eating, we all said we could definitely eat more. This also goes back to the substance point I made. \n\n I'm not sure if this place wants the customers to leave more room for the beer or not? If that's the case then they need to lower the food prices. This place needs some time to figure out how to be \"cool/urban\" while also catering to the area. We like to eat, a lot!  I like that they have different options outside of usual wings, mozzarella sticks and fried zucchini selection that are a staple of the South Hills, but don't cheat us!

Other than a couple of people sitting at the bar, we were the first people in the restaurant. When we left, the restaurant still didn't strike me as particularly busy. My friend and I both ordered fish tacos, which were one of the specials of the day. I requested a side salad rather than the chips and salsa: yes, I'm one of those pesky substitution-requesting people (my request was accommodated without hesitation or irritation). The salad looked appetizing, but since it was delivered without any silverware, I set it to the side and ended up taking it home (we asked for silverware when our entrees arrived, which was the next time that we saw a restaurant employee nearby). As a side note, I'm not sure whether the person who brought our entrees and silverware, and who then kindly boxed up my salad for me and brought the bill was the owner or manager, but he was far more helpful and friendly than our waitress, who never even refilled our water glasses (though she did check in to see that our food had arrived okay). \n\nThe fish tacos were disappointing, to say the least. The fish itself had been fried in a crispy but flavorless batter. The majority of the real estate on the three flour tortillas, though, was occupied by lettuce, tomatoes, and a few strands of cheese. Lemon wedges rounded out the plate. (The fact that the dish was intended to be served with chips and salsa is duly noted.) Although we both attacked the fish with a salt shaker and our lemons, the dish was still very one-note. It really needed bite from onions, jalapenos--anything to make it not...well, BLAND. As it was, we ended up putting tartar sauce on our tacos. Yes, really. \n\nOn the up-side, the meal was quite reasonably priced: in fact, I don't believe BBJ's charged me for the substitution, which I fully expected them to do. But, in the final analysis, it took me over 2 years to try BBJ's again after my initial visit.

I opted for a refund because the last thing I'd want is to sit through the process once again to only have the same issue occur. However, I was told they do not offer refunds at their salon being how the lash artist work off commission and is paid weekly. So I decided to just somehow get my money's worth and schedule another appt. to re-do my lashes. At time of appt. I was still charged a $40 difference for the volume set. When volume is what should have been done the first time around and whichever set was put on initially didn't even last a few days. For all the inconvenience as is you would think they would have just waived the $40 difference. I didn't want to hassle and just happily paid the difference.  Only hoping that this time around it would be done correctly. I was fortunate enough to be booked with Kayu who was very sweet and listened to my concerns and what I wanted as far as length prior to beginning.The result came out definitely a whole lot better than the first time but was still a bit all over the place. David, Kayu and staff are all very nice wonderful people. However, after redoing my lashes last Thursday only being 4 days passed since then so many has fallen off again. So I'm pretty much back at the same spot. With the same problems as stated above only with longer lashes this time around.

I always crave the soup noodles but I don't know if it's worth it anymore..\n\nLast week, I was home for spring break and of course we went to Tin Tin to satisfy my noodle craving.  We got there, and we waited for about 20 minutes until we were seated - not a bad wait for 7pm on a Saturday night.  \n\nIn the past, my parents always complained how the waitresses couldn't speak english and didn't smile or ask about how we were doing.  This time around, however, our waitress was very friendly and fluent in english - both pleasant surprises.  \n\nSo the night was off to a great start.  But then! (dun dun dun!) I found a piece of plastic in the beef/noodle stirfry. We told the waitress and asked to see the manager.  The waitress apologized many times but the manager failed to show up for 10 minutes.  Now, usually if something like this happens, then my expecation is that the manager comes over as soon as he or she is free, apologizes, and then usually offers some sort of compensation.  So I was just sitting there for what felt like forever (although it was only 10 minutes), watching him stand at the podium idly, checking the seating list at times and calling people over.  I think that is a job that the hostess can do herself while you leave for two minutes.  Furthermore, when he came, he looked at the piece of plastic and apologized in a \"sorry not sorry\" tone without any offer of a discount for our meal.  Knowing that this would be my last visit, I ordered one last bowl of noodles.  Goodbye yummy noodles forever.. \n\nFor the amount you pay for this food, go somewhere fancy downtown.

It just so happen to be close by in the Harris Teeter parking lot. One of their customers recommended this Firestone. Since it was close and the tow truck wouldn't have to go far, I reluctantly chose to come here which I regret now. \n\nFirst of all, I consider myself a mechanic too but being out of state with no tools and no machine to read the codes to tell me why my car wouldn't start, I trusted this place. \n\nThey stated they would have to do diagnostic test and said it would be $59. However, the service advisor came back later and said it would be $99 for a full diagnostic test. \n\nTroubleshooting the problem: After a couple hours, they called me to the desk and said i would need the following:\n\nStarter\nBattery\nFuel Pump\nFuel Filter \nVacuum Line\n\nI thought to my self, there's no way all those auto parts went bad at the same time on my car. They gave me a price of $229 for the battery. I told them I can buy it at Advance Auto Parts for $169. So,  I bought it at Advance and brought it back and put it in myself. However, I had someone else to check battery and they said all it needed was a slow charge.  The mechanic said that my starter was \"fried\" which the manager agreed was not very professional words used by the mechanic. I didn't believe anything was wrong with my starter. So, I told them to just put the fuel pump, fuel filter and vacuum line on and we will see if it will start up afterwards. For these 3 parts and labor they gave a price of over $1204. \n\nMy investigation:  I called up a neighbor Firestone in Fort Mill and the woman gave a me price of $584.87 for the fuel pump, fuel filter and labor. Why is the price so far apart in difference.  I questioned the manager about the call I made to Fort Mill Firestone and told him the woman gave me a price of $584.87. He said \" can't be\". I repeated myself and said I just called them and that's the price she gave me. Again, he says \"can't be\" while shaking his head. I felt like he just called me a liar.  I also called up some other repair shops and they were a lot cheaper too. Most prices were in the upper $550 to $590 range including a Firestone in Cleveland, Mississippi. \n\nAnother price difference:  I called up Advance Auto Parts and they gave me a price of $269 for the fuel pump which has the fuel filter with it included. Yet, this Firestone want to charge me about $450 just for that fuel pump. This is not a parts house. They buy their parts from places like Advance, Autozone and etc then add a markup to that price.\n\nFinal Thoughts:  Yes, I know I helped their profit here big time. I trusted them. I will never use any Firestone in the Carolinas again. I just feel like I was done wrong. I didn't need no starter. It cranked up fine after they put the fuel pump on.

Well I did and to be honest it wasn't all that I anticipated to be especially for 6oz and 180$. First off the steak was served in 2 pieces. 1 piece was 3 oz and supposedly a section of the ribeye and the other 3 oz piece was the fat cap. I was skeptical about the fact that a chef would serve such a delicate piece of meat decomposed into 2 parts especially one of that quality in this case it was supposedly grade A5. Nevertheless I went with the flow. In my opinion 1 of the 2 pieces of beef was not Wagyu ribeye but rather some other cut of beef. The fat ratio was not present and the 3oz ribeye was not tender. The \"fat cap\" piece was indeed Wagyu quality which I thoroughly enjoyed but the ribeye portion was not. I was disappointed but I didn't let that ruin my experience. The service was fantastic, the best I ever had. Both waiters were attentive and very knowledgeable. The reason why I am giving this 2 stars regardless of the poor food quality is the following, as my friend and I reviewed our 528$ bill for the evening I noticed a random $2 charge listed as a Sauce. I did ask the server to bring me a side of the House sauce but didn't expect he would charge me for it. Not a big deal, I can afford $2 it's the principle that counts. When I asked him about it and told him that I think it was kind of ridiculous that I am being charged an extra $2 for the house steak sauce, the comment was \" that's absolutely right, $2 for the sauce\".

Luckily, I came to see just that one. I had already looked at it online.\n\nI show up, begin to head inside, and am met by a salesperson (Sean, from Michigan) who promptly runs to meet me before I enter the showroom. Immediately I inform him of which vehicle I came to look at and he quickly obliges by bringing a golf cart to the front for us to drive to the vehicle.  \n\nWe get to the Trailhawk and the sticker price is priced about $2k higher than online. I inform Sean of this, and he takes a minute to look at the website, confirms what I said, and lets me know that they would honor the online price. The sticker price contradicting the online price was a little off putting. What if I hadn't checked online first? So, we get in the Jeep, Sean drives it to the gas station to fill up and lets me know that I am fine to go ahead and get into the driver's seat.\n\nI move over to the driver's seat. Meanwhile, he is paying for the gas, and as Im sitting there, Im looking around checking everything out. The first noticeable mishap was a scratch on the interior door. I mention it to him and he brushes it off as just residue that will wash off. Umm, no, it was clearly NOT just residue, nevermind that I already saw him scratch the tint with the seatbelt buckle. \n\nAs Im looking around more, I can't help but think that this 2018 vehicle with 4 miles on it, literally looks like it has been 'used.' It was dirty and there was trash in the door, I guess from a previous test drive? It just wasn't presentable at all. Sean made sure to mention that it had been on the lot for about a month and that usually cars don't stay on the lot that long. Okay, sooo, why is THIS one still there?\n\nThen, comes the nitty gritty part of car buying, the money and the numbers. BEFORE I even indicate whether or not I actually want to proceed with the purchase, Sean insists that I hurry and fill out the credit application. I promptly put things on hold, informing him that we needed to talk a liiiittle bit more about the exact details before we go any further.\n\nAfter honoring the online price and offering $5k for my trade in, I let him know that the offer on the trade in just won't work at all. Good thing I did ample research before coming in because I was well aware that EVEN as a trade in, my vehicle was worth at least $7k. So after a bit of back and forth and him leaving to ask the manager, we settle on $6500. \n\nNext, was time to talk about financing and down payment. Luckily, they didn't really give me any hassle on wanting to go through my own third party broker for financing, but once we started talking about down payment, the conversation took a pretty crazy turn. \n\nI insisted that I wanted to put a down payment to lower the financed amount. I let Sean know, that I wanted to pay in cash, not check, of which I would have to go and get. He informs me that he doesn't think they can take cash as a down payment. So funny because the dealership I ended up buying from, let me pay using my debit card (same as cash).\n\nSo, we went from first, putting a down payment to, we don't take cash, can you write a check to, how about you don't put a down payment AT ALL to, okay we CAN take cash to, why do you have to go and GET the cash, can't your boyfriend just bring it to you?\n\nAt this point, I realize that this is all going way wrong. For one, I am, in not so many words, somewhat being held hostage (they have the keys to my trade in, of which I had to ask for when I began heading towards the exit). I'm asked not to leave to get my down payment, THEN, Sean begins grasping at straws to get me to proceed with filling out the credit app. I oblige just to get him to stop hassling me. Deciding that I'm really not into this particular Trailhawk, I ask if there's any way they can keep an eye out on a white one for me instead.\n\nSean tells me they CAN'T keep an eye out for a white one and continues trying everything in his power to get me not to leave, even after we discussed that I wanted to go get cash. I finally am allowed to leave but only if I promise to be back in 45 minutes, nevermind, the place I need to go is across town (It was about 5pm and he wanted an exact time of how long it would take for me to get the money). It was very awkward. He informs me that while I'm gone, they'll go ahead and run my app, and I beg them to hold off until I get back. \n\nObviously at this point, Im NOT coming back. Had Sean not been so pushy, and not forthcoming regarding the fact that they COULD have looked out for a white Trailhawk for me, (he later back peddled over text, and told me they could make it happen) I may have proceeded with my purchase here.

I'm not sure how ideal that section is for the kids.   You do get to cheer for the villain that has pyrotechnics who's pretty awesome a bit later on though so maybe that has extra draw to the kids. \n\nI like the show.

The one constant between the four flavors that I sampled were that they were at least sort of moist. But flavorful, meh, not so much. I tried the chocolate, carrot, lemon, and caramel. \n\nSo here is the breakdown on the little cakes:\n1) The chocolate is (duh) chocolate cake with a chocolate/raspberry  mouse filling and topped with ganache. The cake was dark like chocolate, but pretty dull in flavor. The filling was there, but not discernable enough to stand out as a flavor unto itself. And the ganache was more like dry chocolaty icing. IMO, not really worth the calories.\n2) The caramel is a butter cake (think yellow) filled with caramel mouse and topped with a light caramel frosting. The cake was a pretty standard yellow cake. The filling was again so mild in flavor that there really wasn't much point in its being there. The frosting, described as mildly flavored, was more of an understatement. I really think it was white frosting with a light glazing of caramel underneath. IMO, really not worth the calories or the price. \n3)The carrot is filled with cream cheese mouse and topped with cream cheese frosting. At least this one resembled it's description, but I wasn't blown away.\n4) The lemon is a lemon cake, filled with lemon chiffon, and topped with lemon frosting. This was the closest thing to decent in the half dozen that I took home. I couldn't detect any lemon in the cake, but the filling almost had a hint of tartness and the frosting actually had some zest mixed in (which is what I would expect).\n\nI will definitely support Sweet Thang as a downtown addition, but will probably stick to their lunches. The search for the ultimate cupcake will have continue... although my sister did suggest that she back me in the business after this latest go round. : )", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "I've tried all the signature Korean dishes here but I wasn't exactly impressed.

Although my boss booked a room with 2 beds, since my coworker and I were sharing a room, they assigned us to a room with 1 bed.  When we called the desk to complain they said we could come back to the front desk and they would reassign us.  They had put us at the very last room on the 6th floor in the pyramid, and it was a very long walk back to the front desk.  We discussed it for a minute and decided we could live with one bed, and proceeded to unpack and settle in.  Not 10 min. later SOMEONE ELSE ENTERED THE ROOM WITH A KEY CARD!  We were shocked!  They reassigned our room even though we had not returned to the front desk.  Just where did they think we were?  This couple was there for the same trade show.  It was awkward but we decided to pack up and move after the front desk agreed to send a bellman with a cart and our new room keys.  It took about 15 min. so we had to wait in the hall until he arrived.  We had hoped for a closer room, but no, now they put us at the next to the last room on the 9th floor.  Err.\n\nThe good news is our room was nice and it was so much better having our own beds.  However, we missed a short reception before dinner with all the moving and unpacking.  The room was fairly large with a room safe (I like these) and large 2-sink bathroom.  The shower was large but the shower head was terrible.

Options available for the most part are ordinary.  Quality is what you would expect of a buffet.  The dishes were lukewarm, bordering on almost cold.  Sushi is stale and dry.  Roast beef was average, but the chef that manned the carving station is a total sweetheart!  Shrimp and grits was, well, shrimp and grits.  The pulled pork sliders were better than I expected.  Didn't try the mini hotdogs.  Didn't try the cold fried chicken.  No king crab legs.  Didn't even go near the Asian section as the dishes looked stale, you know that dull-dry-sauce-look on foods?  Yep.  So what did I try?  The mushroom truffle soup, salty and creamy, it was alright if you like those flavors.  The clam chowder was alright, not as bad as I thought.  But nowhere near as good as the clam chowders from San Francisco (not a fair comparison as Vegas is in the desert and SF is by the bay).  I noticed that no one touched the salads on their plates, so I didn't go there either.  Boy, it sounds like I tried a lot of nothing!  But I actually tried 4 plates worth of food.  But nothing really stood out!  Oh yeah, the seafood paella looked great!  And it was actually just GOOD, not great.  You know what they had a lot of?  4 different pizzas; cheese, pepperoni, mushroom and deluxe style.  But who wants to eat pizza for this price!  And they had lots of sauces and salsa for the Mexican cuisine station...16 sauces and salsa! C'mon! Who is going to waste stomach space on salsa and chips!

Only five to choose from and they were stale.\n\nA small island for desserts.  Now I admit, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so the desserts were mediocre.  The chocolate lava cake was probably the best thing there, it was piping hot and oozing when I broke into it.  Nothing special about the gelato and I'm a huge gelato fan!  Only the lemon sorbet was palatable.  Tried the pistachio, raspberry, and mango also, meh.  \n\nSo is this buffet worth the high price tag? Not in my book.

The room was very comfortable and had a contemporary feel. It was equipped with a small fridge and microwave with a sink. Great place to stay for the road warrior. The day we were to check out, we decided to try their restaurant which offered a $10 breakfast buffet. It was a really expensive deal as the buffet was very basic. On top of that, one of the waitress has started putting things away as people were still trickling in. The kids' menu was very basic and I thought I'd just complement their breakfast by adding yoghurt and fruit from the buffet. As a parent, I wanted them to have a more balanced breakfast. No big deal, I'll eat less and they can have my share. It's a buffet! That's when one of the waitress snapped at me saying that she should charge me for the banana and the yoghurt since those items are only for adults who pay for the buffet. She went off for a good 5 minutes and I was just amazed at how she would worry about charging a customer for a 25 cent banana and a 50 cent yoghurt when the customer just spent more than $300 in her establishment. I was going to take her name down but suddenly, everyone went into hiding in the kitchen. So, I had to bring this to the manager's attention. I believe his name was B.J. He did a great job taking care of the issue. Zach, at the front desk was also great. So, thumbs up for the remodeling and customer service at the hotel.

Sort of I guess, it is much smaller and the 'fresh' produce occupies maybe 2 sq. ft. of cooler space since put there about two weeks ago....\nStupid long lines, very loud with music and the 'your meal is ready numero tres tres uno' Spanglish microphone girls.\nThe lowdown-went with three friends and had pollo asado (a.k.a. grilled chicken) plate that I split with one of them and the other two both had chicken monster tacos.  Not too bad a value, the salsa bar was included and had a number of very good candidates.  And praise be, the rice was actually pretty kick @ss!!  Pollo Asado, although flavorful, was dry and we got dark meat which tends to last a little longer over the mesquite fire.  Good BIG steamy flour tortillas.\nFor my money, the Ranch Market is right down the street so I'd likely go there instead of La Tolteca next time but that is a fairly high standard.", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "Stumbled across this place after an afternoon happy hour hopping on bikes. After being disappointed with the shit service at several other spots, we went by The Crown development and popped in Phoenix Ale.\n\nDig the building, looks very cool. The bar for Phoenix Ale is awesome, and has an interesting mid-century industrial look. \n\nService was great. Very helpful and friendly bartender. Walked us through happy hour specials and was happy to chat about menu items.\n\nOrdered a pizza. A square pizza that came in a baking pan. It was awesome. Sort of \"Detroit\" style, but with a thinner crust. Their happy hour selections of sliders and fish and chips also sounded epic, but I was too full to throw down. Next time, for sure...\n\nThey lose 2 stars because of the beer selection. House beers are AWFUL! Seriously some of the worst I've encountered, the IPA is garbage. Arizona cannot create good beer, and I wish Phoenix Ale would expand their offerings to include more drinkable beers.

Growing up in Texas, bfast tacos are a diet staple but outside those state lines you can only find breakfast burritos- which are totally NOT the same thing. At all. \n\nPlate here includes two massive tacos on double-layer corn, with options to add sausage, chorizo, or bacon to your eggs, cheese is included and condiments of sour cream and salsa are provided. You also get a potato side (reds or browns).\nHuge portion: tortillas were overflowing, removed over half the filling before I could even pick up the tacos to eat properly (not a complaint!), and the corn tortillas held up so well that I was able to stick to a single layer and used the extras to make additional tacos with the overflow!\nNot following? You can easily make 4 good sized tacos with this plate.\n\nChicken fajita omelet is a good pick too- potato side and bread side included (toast, english muffin, or biscuit). Servers have no problem with substitutions, and easily changed out my bell peppers for extra mushrooms. Sadly, the mushrooms seemed canned, but there as a more than generous portion of veggies in the dish. Hashbrowns were undercooked, but we didn't come close to finishing.\n\nNow for my gripe. You're the BISCUIT Caf\u00e9- not the breakfast taco caf\u00e9, not the omelet cafe. The biscuits here were lackluster and dismal, with little taste and an oddly crunchy exterior. Fluffy interior was great and the raspberry jam we received was off the charts, but when we ordered a side of gravy ... well, that was bad, too. Virtually tasteless and gluey, like a poorly made box mix. \n\nI didn't expect the breakfast tacos to knock it out of the park like they did (highly recommend the bacon and chorizo), but to fail at making your namesake dish?
