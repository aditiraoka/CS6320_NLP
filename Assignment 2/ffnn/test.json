For those complaining about the bread used, I will say that if Rock Lobster is paying homage to the Lobster Rolls of the East Coast, then this is an authentic choice and nicely prepared.

I figure the pricetag is somewhat inflated because we're dealing with seafood, but part of it is, I'm sure, just because. Rock Lobster isn't terrible value for what you get, I suppose, but it's not great either.\n\nAlso, they have a sign outside proclaiming they have been voted the best patio in Toronto... Does Toronto only have one patio? Because RL's patio is fine insofar that they do, in fact, have outdoor seating, but there's nothing especially great about it or the location. If you like to dine al fresco, then you have that option, but it's pretty bare bones/minimalist.\n\nRock Lobster: It's fine. You could do worse, but I'm sure you could do better too.

If you were to ask someone who is South Asian or Middle-Eastern their opinion, they might direct you elsewhere (e.g. Paramount), but I have no real qualms with Me Va Me. It's expensive ($21.95 for a salmon skewer box makes is not easy on a lunch budget) but the quality is great if you pick the right items. I've dabbled in many of its choices - the Moroccan cigars (which are so named for their shape - not a cigarette but more of a fried roll), the falafel, and two variations of the chicken skewers box (grilled vegetables or rice) and most recently, the chicken shawarma. The first two items were not as memorable but I have to say the chicken is great - tender, moist and brilliant when paired with the rice (if you are willing to spoil yourself with white rice!). The grilled vegetables aren't a bad alternative when in pursuit of a healthier option. My friend thought it was dry but I thought it was quite nice. I've ordered it several times and will likely continue if I have the chance! The shawarma was okay - not the best I've had (pro tip: if you're ever in Europe, find a hole-in-the-wall shawarma place and prepare to be kind-blown for \u20ac5), but not poor either. What Me Va Me does better than anyone else in my opinion is hummus. This is easily the best hummus I've ever had and I have recommended it to friends aplenty, none of which have returned displeased.

We were there on a Tuesday night so while it was crowded, it wasn't packed and there were a few empty tables.  Once we finished our cocktails, barely, the wait staff kept buzzing by to whisk the empties away, and in fact, came by again while we were waiting to pay the check, to start clearing the table, which I found sort of uncomfortable and not reflective of great service.

They were booked for a Saturday night, so we sat in the bar area where you can still order off of the full menu. We ordered:\n\n-Black Fettucine (Crab, Jalapenos, Shallots, Main Course Portion $38): Very light tasting, and you could taste the sweetness from the squid ink. The pasta tasted fresh, but it wasn't the best pasta that I've had. Overall solid dish, but not worth the $38- we upgraded to a main course portion and it was still TINY!!\n-Dry Aged Bone-In Ribeye for 2 $144: WOW for this dish- they bring over a huge piece of bone-in ribeye and carve it at your table, which is a cool bonus presentation. We ordered it medium rare, and it came out perfect even though our server warned us it might be on the rare side. The ribeye tasted good on it's own, but adding a sauce to dip our meat in would have been a good idea. There was a lot of beef to go around, but I'm not sure it if was worth $144.. maybe $100 or $125 max.\n-Bison Carpaccio (Garlic, Radish Greens, Basil $19): YUM- the bison is sliced super thin and the meat melts in your mouth. A must order in my opinion.\n-Side of Roasted Beets (w/ Pistachios and Gorgonzola $9): Solid- the beets were nice and tender but the overall dish didn't work super well together.\n-Strawberry Shortcake (w/ Honey Macerated Strawberries $13): Pretty good, but the shortcake pieces were small and I didn't think it was worth $13.\n-Vanilla Bean Affogato: Solid affogato.\n\nAgain, although I enjoyed most of my dishes here, I just wasn't wowed. For the price point and portion sizes, I won't be back- there are just so many other amazing restaurants to eat at in Vegas!

On one hand, it is located in a prime location- in the middle of Old Montreal and walking distance to the metro and several attractions. On the other hand, everything else..\n\nThe location is the major seller of this hotel, being in the middle of the most popular neighborhoods for tourists. But if you are driving, be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for their valet parking. The fee when we visited in Oct 2017 was $35CAD per night with in/out privileges. However, due to the space issue in the area their lot is not directly on site, so you have to call the front desk 15 minutes in advance to when you actually need you car. We ended up parking at a nearby lot for $18CAD/night.\n\nWe checked in on a Friday and the front desk attendant was friendly enough, she informed us that our room was in a different building and a valet would come to help us with our bags. We weren't sure what this meant so we just went with it. We were sent 2 blocks away into a tiny building with a restaurant and bar directly underneath us. This should have been a red flag, but we were too tired and confused.\n\nWe didn't realize that most of the rooms would not be in the main building. And that there would be no elevator. Our room was small and dated, but had a rustic feel to it with the exposed walls, wooden floors, and oversized windows. The view was obstructed by the building across the street, but we didn't really care too much. The room was clean enough, and came stocked with a full kitchen which was nice.\n\nIt all seemed fine until nighttime came. The beds here are extremely soft, something I am not used to, but I'm sure many others would love. The restaurant and bar downstairs was listed to close at 11, and the from desk even confirmed it. But for some reason, the music(and extremely heavy bass) was still going very loudly until past 1am. Even with our windows and curtains tightly shut, we could hear the restaurant's customer on the street being loud. We couldn't say for sure if they were drunk, but either way they were painfully loud. The bf is not by any means a light sleeper, and even he lost sleep. We ended up not being able to get up as early as we had planned because we were both just too tired. The next night was Saturday and by 9pm the noise got significantly louder. We wanted to go to bed but even if we had purchased earplugs, the thumping of the bass was enough to disturb us. We called the front desk, and they offered to move us. After about 40 minutes, we were moved to another building about 3 blocks away. They tried to explain that noise is a common issue in the neighborhood, but I don't think it is since our new room was nice and quiet for the rest of our stay (and on a Saturday night). Additinally, I don't know if our complaining had anything to do with the fact that when we called in for a razor, they came back 20m later to say that they were out of razors and didn't offer me any alternative solutions (like, where can I go buy one, will they have more the day after, etc.??).\n\nWhile I greatly appreciate their moving us to a different room without much hassle, I also really don't understand how they can operate their business this way. The entire first building we stayed must be a nightmare to stay in at night. Also, when I asked, the front desk assured me that the resraurant/bar closed at 11pm- but they had their music and custormers outside well past 1am! If you're going to try to cover that up, at least try harder. She sounded confused as to why I would complain, and I had to justify it by saying that we slept early since we like getting an early start.\n\nOverall, I really don't think we would stay here again or recommend it to our friends.

I had actually heard about this place from a friend a few months ago, so we had to try it.  I was especially interested in trying the fried chicken sandwich, but silly me- it's not on the dinner menu!\n\nJust a few notes:\n-We were seated right away.  The first thing we noticed was that the restaurant's name is LITERALLY on everything, haha.  \n-It's a little dim in the restaurant, in fact the older groups surrounding our table were actually using the flashlight apps on their phones to read the menu.  \n-My boyfriend and I were wearing jeans and a t-shirt, which made us stick out like sore thumbs!  \n-The chef was hanging out in the front the whole time and didn't greet any customers or walk up to any tables, including the special event that was going on.  This may seem nitpicky, but it seemed weird that he was just kinda doing nothing the whole time!\n-Meal sizes are small.  Not a complaint, just an observation in case you're reading this and planning a dinner on a budget!\n-There is a large seafood selection!\n\nFirst, based on a recommendation from our server (very friendly), we ordered the grilled octopus ($16).  It was tender and had a nice char; the sauce underneath and the other components all fit pretty well together.  Unfortunately, the bus boy took our plate without asking if we were finished!\n\nWe shared the special ($30 for two 5oz. Lamb porter house steaks, cooked medium rare).  It was perfectly cooked and I swear I tasted some type of Indian/Mediterranean flavors in the jus.  Not a lot to savor, but we're supposed to be thinking quality over quantity!\n\nFinally, we ordered two desserts- the brookie and bread pudding.  I love a good bread pudding that is moist and drenched in sauce.  This was not a great bread pudding and I was pretty disappointed!  It's a HUGE serving comparable to a rubix cube and SUPER dry.  There was not enough sauce and it wasn't gooey or sickeningly sweet like bread pudding is supposed to be!  The \"brookie\" is a chocolate chip cookie housed in a brownie with salted caramel icecream on top.  All components were good, but I'm not so sure either dessert was worth the $9.   ***FYI, 2 desserts is too much!*** \n\nOverall our dinner totalled $68 (not including tip).", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "In comparison, you can get the same quality food in Scarborough for much much cheaper!", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "My 4 year old niece asked me for sushi at 10:55am lol.

Therefore, it's not suprising that if you take one of their outstanding bartenders and put her in another place, there will be great cocktails.\n\nI visited Harvard & Highland with a group of friends this past Saturday night.  Arrived on the earlier side, grabbed a table, and ordered cocktails from the very creative list of original creations available.  Overall, the space is small (as big as Union downstairs) but has great floor to ceiling windows that look out on the street corner.  There were about 4 tables on the left, a few stand-up tables, a few wooden beach chairs near the corners, and about 8 seats at the small bar.  Being fairly new, the place still had the nice smell of fresh-cut wood!\n\nAfter our waiter delivered our cocktails, that was the last we saw of him for the evening.  After a long time wondering why he hadn't come back, I saw him in street clothes with a backpack heading out the door.  No other person came by to take our orders.  Getting impatient, for the rest of the evening we had to get our drinks directly from the bar which was challenging because the place was getting more and more crowded.  By around midnight, H&H was jammed packed and there seemed to be only 2 bartenders frantically working.  It was clear they were very understaffed.\n\nIf Harvard & Highland stays as popular as it was this past Saturday, they're going to need to hire more help.  Their inability to keep up with the crowd almost certainly cost them money (we ourselves would have ordered more had we the opportunity).  I suspect this will change as H&H figure out when they're going to be the most crowded.\n\nIt's important to note that cocktails are the only thing on the menu.  There's a few non-alcoholic seltzer drinks.  I was surprised there wasn't a selection of high-end bourbon or other hard alcohols if you didn't want one of the speciality cocktails.  There's also no food at all (but Union is downstairs if you want to eat beforehand).  \n\nThis is a great space with a great bartender and a lot of potential.

It was delicious!  I tried their Truffle Mushroom MAC on the Boat Cruise Yelp Event before, but it was different from the one I had at the restaurant.  The one on the Boat event was sour.  I wasn't sure if it was because the food sat on the boat for too long or because of other reasons.  I prefer to eat at a restaurant, especially for MAC.  I'm sure that MAC is perfect for eating when it's just finished!  PARKA MAC is a good choice for vegan and people who are lactose tolerant. \n\n*** The CREAMY VEGAN CHEESE SAUCE is made from fresh vegetable and cashew.  Without the nuts, the sauce won't be quite as creamy.  So, if you have cashew or nut allergy, you need to get something else. \n*** NOTE. All MAC items contain nuts, including some other dishes.  \n\n2) CAULIFLOWER SOUP (4.5/5)\nI like the soup while some of us thought it was a bit salty.  If you think it is too salty for you, you can dip it with your burger too.  It was another way to tone the saltiness down.  \n\n3) PORTOBELLO BURGER (4/5)\n4) POTATO BURGER (3/5) \nIf I have to choose which burger is tastier, I will have the Portobello burger.  I love mushroom, and PARKA FOOD knows the right way to cook their mushroom.  A bunless option is also available as request.  They will serve your burger on a bed of ORGANIC ARUGULA instead of buns.  Very healthy, indeed!\n\nWe tried three side dishes which were;\n5) ONION RINGS w/ Chipotle Aioli (3.5/5)\n6) CAULIFLOWER FRITTERS w/ Garlic Aioli (3/5) \n7) FRIES (2.5/5)\nIt seemed that everyone including the table next to us like the Cauliflower Fritters more than those two side dishes. They couldn't stop eating it.   However, I prefer the Onion Rings than the Cauliflower Fritters.  I thought that the Cauliflower Fritters were a bit too salty for me.  I'm also a fan of onion rings lol.  The Fries were quite salty for us too or maybe we had too many fried stuff already lol.  However, Fries are never good without salt.  If you don't like salty food, you might be able to ask them to do less salt on fries.  I'm sure they're willing to do it for you. \n\nDRINKS\nGINGER SODA (4/5)\nSTRAWBERRY SODA (3/5)\nGRAPEFRUIT SODA (3/5)\nThey have Four types of soda drinks.  My favourite one is the GINGER SODA.   It was refreshing!  They have Coffee, Tea, Beer, and Cider as well.  You can have a small vegan party here, Cheers! \n\nAMBIANCE (4/5)  It is an opened-kitchen.  You can see food prep right there at the counters.  I like the clean and modern looks of the restaurant. \n\nSERVICE (5/5) \n\nOVERALL (3.7/5)\nThe concept of commitment to sustainability is cool. \nThe food is good.  The owner, Eric and his staff are nice and friendly.  Thank you for inviting me to the tasting event.  It was a nice experience.  I would recommend it to anyone, especially my vegan friends.   Also, I will come back to have my Truffle Mushroom again or try out other soup items. Happy Eating!", "stars": 4.0}, {"text": "Yummy!

My two girlfriends and I visited for mani/pedi girl session a couple of weeks before a wedding. I hate to admit it but while I have a loyalty to my hair stylist in Green I follow special deals for my nails. Groupon was doing a special at Fringe so we all decided to go together on a \"girl day\". An added aspect I enjoyed was on their website you can fill out a \"appointment request\" form and someone will get back to you quickly via phone or e-mail. \n\nFirst off, the Fringe people are FABULOUS. Not only were they able to get all 3 of us in for mani/pedis at the same time, they seemed sincere in the effort to help group us together. They had two girls working on us and they were so friendly and it almost seemed like the 5 of us had been friends forever and were just hanging out. They were extremely patient and had genuine suggestions for nail color (let's be honest 3 mani/pedis are going to take awhile). While we were there my two girlfriends decided to get their eyebrows waxed as well after the nails and the girls at Fringe were only happy to help. \n\nNot only were the girls at Fringe extremely awesome, but the salon atmosphere was comfortable, open, and inviting....all elements I associate with a relaxing day trip to the salon. The salon is in a shopping plaza, but it looked like they had expanded into two stores so the whole salon is open and airy. The elegant decor made me feel as if I was at a high price salon. \n\n\nI would love to go back to Fringe solely for the inviting atmosphere and friendly staff. It's a place I could get loyal to about my nails. However, the prices are a little out of my limited budget.

I had the Angus on wheat with swiss, jalapeno bacon and a fried egg. Very good burger, although the patty did lack some seasoning but that may just be a personal gripe as I opt for seasoned meat over a plethora of toppings. Do watch out for the first bite when getting the fried egg, lets just say it was closer to sunny side up than over medium. \n\nMy second time at the BB I was a bit displeased with the overall experience. The hostesses were rude and there were 3 of them standing doing nothing at a podium made for one person. The only thing worse than the attitude was the fact that the wait was about an hour but I can deal with the wait, its Vegas and there is always something to do while you are waiting. On to the food, I mistakenly ordered the slider sampler thinking that I could get a taste of the buffalo and kobe burgers without having to order the entire burger.

We had a five-person party and were seated immediately after checking in with our reservation. The ambience is definitely nice - there's a darker restaurant with large TVs and a bar, and a separate \"party\" area with four massive tables and sliding door entry to the room.\n\nWe all had the lunch AYCE special, which I found to be very fair for the price (about $16 or so per person). We did a mix of Korean and Japanese (sushi) dishes, and it was generally on point across the board.\n\nI can't say I'm big on the bibimbob (just a personal preference - nothing to do with the quality of the food), but everything was great. We had a couple large orders of sushi, kimchi, short ribs and seaweed salad, and the waitresses accommodated us very well (gave us extra ginger, spicy mayo, a pitcher of water). There were a couple points where food we ordered didn't come out until much later (sometimes, an hour or more after we ordered), but that's a minor gripe.\n\nSome of the portion sizes were also small (e.g. one spring roll per AYCE order), so we had to order multiples at a time. The dessert ice cream sizes weren't anything to write home about either.\n\nThe hostess was very friendly, and was nice enough to wheel out the birthday cake we brought on a rolling tray. We ended up giving her a slice of it in appreciation.\n\nInsofar as the \"Korean BBQ\" aspect, I can't really comment on it.

This is despite having congratulatory certificates from the City of Mississauga on its opening in August 2015 - I assume that these were from another location that was nearby and closed, or from the restaurant before it was renovated. Regardless, I knew to keep my expectations fully in check.\n\nThe meal started out very slow, as we had to wait for a long time for salad, bread and refills. Our server, Colin, was very apologetic, and we could see that there was a sudden influx of people lined up by the door, and in subzero weather no less. Later on, he and another server mentioned in passing that there were problems with the restaurant's automated order system, which was causing orders to get backlogged and delayed. I attributed it to growing pains, although I understand there was another family sitting next to us who was dealing with the exact same problem and eventually got fed up and left.\n\nThe food was a mixed bag overall. The dish I ordered (double-bacon carbonara) and the one my mother ordered (chicken tetrazzini) was hot and tasted great, but everyone else's dishes had to be sent back. My grandmother's grilled chicken was dry, while my grandfather's hamburger and fries was overcooked/cold, respectively. We ended up sending three of the dishes back, and the server told us that those would be comp'd for us.\n\nWhy, then, am I giving this four stars? The servers were all incredibly polite and focused on making sure we had a great experience, despite how busy the restaurant was. The entire staff made time to come out and sing to me for my birthday, the server (Colin) was very apologetic and got to us as quickly as he could, and in the end, the manager decided to comp our entire meal, which was an unexpected surprise.\n\nIf you go in with your expectations firmly in check (after all, the restaurant did open two weeks earlier, as of this review's publication date), you'll have a good time.

My sister's eyes grew big while I was ordering, but I reassured her that they couldn't be that big for $1.75. Boy was I wrong. If you are going by pictures, look at the scale of pupusas to plate ratio. These big stuffed flat breads are superb.\n\nThe mix and cheese were the best because of the nice crispy edges.

I train about 6 days a week and cycle through a few different gyms depending upon my needs. I travel quite a bit and have subs to Golds, LA Fitness and 24 Hours Super Sport. In the past I have worked as a personal trainer and am an Army vet whose MOS required a high level of physical ability. I perform a lot of proprioception (balance/stability) type routines mixed in with range of motion exercises and strength training. \n\nIn my professional opinion the big pro of this gym is Kyle the trainer. In all my years both personally and professionally he is without a doubt the best trainer I have ever seen. Its not just his knowledge which is extensive, but the manner in which he interacts with his clients. This is a guy who is more than just passionate about what he does, he is a living example. He coaches, corrects and congratulates. I do not know Kyle personally, except in passing and watching him at work, but I have a great respect for him and only wish I could afford to hire him myself. I have worked with hundreds of trainers in my past including elite military trainers, some of whom are still my friends, and without any doubt I would still rate Kyle as the best.  \n\nIn terms of the gym itself it is actually fairly small when compared to almost every other 24 hour gym in town, except for the one that is downtown. I am often hard pressed to find the space I need to train on a bosu or stability ball which I use extensively throughout my workout. They have a dance/aerobic room upstairs but its not really convenient to keep running up the stairs between sets. As well, the mens locker room is pretty small and can get very cramped during peak hours. Amazingly I have never had a problem finding a free locker. \n\nIn the last year or so the gym has really suffered in terms of cleanliness and the overall state of the equipment. The mens bathroom is horrendous during the daytime hours and they even took out the paper towel dispenser some months ago. This is also the one gym where I rarely see any of the staff make an effort to help put away weights or equipment even during the late evening hours. As with most gyms people seem to grow tired or lazy when it comes to re-racking their weights and the whole place becomes its own obstacle course. \n\nOn the positive side (for me anyways) this location has a pretty hardcore clientele. When Golds gym on sandhil closed this was my go-to gym for hardcore motivation. It's nothing like seeing Cutler, Wolf or Burneike workout at Golds/Sandhill but there are a lot of elite people here and quite a few vets. \n\nThe biggest negative for me at this gym is the management, namely Martin the GM. A few years ago when I started here the staff was incredibly friendly. The manager at the time would even come out to say hello and meet people. This recent manager is rude, unfriendly and dismissive. Of all my friends who work out here, not one has anything positive to stay about him and in fact all my interactions have been very negative. I have 2 friends specifically who have left this gym because of his mistreatment. The good news is that ever since Martin showed up the gym has in my opinion gotten less crowded during the day time when I am usually there. Of course it could just be coincidence or me getting less attentive as I age, but I won't dismiss the obvious either. \n\nAnother negative for me is they actually recently hired a trainer, who might even be the training manager now who has tatoos on his calfs that read \" Cheaters always WIN\" and \"Winners always Cheat\". This to me is the very antithesis of my own personal journey.  I am sure he thought it was funny at the time or perhaps it played to some whimsical sentiment but it seems completely contrary to the whole idea of hiring a trainer in the first place.   \n\nIf you are looking for some hardcore customers to stay motivated and the best trainer in Kyle, this gym is a great option. However, be prepared to overlook the poor management and less than perfect facilities.\n\nUpdate: Added a 4th star. This location has a new manager who is a huge improvement.

Six chicken fingers, large fries, toast, two Cane's Sauce, and a large drink?  Not much color for your diet, but damn near finger lickin' good!  The best way to enjoy Raising Cane's is dining in.  You can tell if you get the freshest food made in the freshest oil.  Fingers and fries will be crisp but not greasy, and the Texas Toast will have a nice crunchy crust.  Dip all this goodness in Cane's Sauce and hot sauce!  If you take Cane's to go you can sometimes get disappointed because the steam in your box can cause the fingers and fries to go soggy, and get your toast wet.  I've had it before to go and it's just not the same!  If possible do dine in!\n\nGotta love a place that serves Coca-Cola.  But even better, sweet tea!

Any sandwich that you get can be made with vegan cheese (I'll leave it up to you to decide if the lack of lacto is worth the lack of flavor: vegan cheese sandwiches here are more similar to melted frisbee sandwiches, tbh, but maybe vegan cheese is a flavor one's palate grows accustomed to?), many melt sandwiches are vegetarian, and the servers \"get\" most other dietary restrictions.

Came here on a Wednesday night to catch \"Die Roten Punkte\" with my wife and some friends. Maybe only 100 seats in the whole room and most were filled. Here's my take: \n\nPros: I LOVE a good intimate venue. I love being able to see the musicians/artist's faces, expressions and actually see their movements whilst performing. DET definitely delivers here. We sat in the front row and were basically a part of the show!\n\nEasy access if you park along 7th street. No crazy stairs, windy walkways or blocks upon city blocks to walk through. Simple access in Spirit Square. \n\nCons: The seats are pretty rickety. I'm a rather broad-shouldered individual. If I were to sit next to an infant (not in a car seat) or an adolescent, I'd be just peachy. Sitting next to another dude my size -- not so much. \n\nAlso, the risers where the seats rest are a little unstable in my opinion. Agree with Chad E on that front. You can definitely feel all of the motion happening in the room. \n\nOverall a very fun, intimate venue to enjoy. Can't wait to catch another show here!

You will not be disappointed.", "stars": 4.0}, {"text": "Greenberg's Deli brings back that loving feeling that's been gone gone gone. Born and raised in the New York metropolitan area I grew up with the loving feeling of dining in delis that serve delicacies from kasha varnishes to Ruben sandwiches. After moving to Las Vegas there has been far less New York delis to enjoy the these delicacies that I love. I am surprised that it took my brother and I over 15 years to try Greenberg's Deli. Better late than never. \n\n   It is appropriate that Greenberg's Deli sits inside New York - New York within a Disneyfied Greenwich Village. Both casino and Deli execute such a commendable job with the theme and attention to detail, that a unique dining experience is guaranteed. The New York City motif is so realistic that you expect to hear a taxi careening down the faux Greenwich Village Street, and instead overhear a runaway Manhattan Rollercoaster taxi above with screaming riders. \n\n   When you step off the Greenwich Village Street into Greenberg's Deli, up above on the wall is  the menu. It advertises the New York City Deli icons including the Ruben, corn beef, and pastrami. Disappointedly yet totally expected Kashe varnishes and kinishes were missing. However, there on the board was an egg salad sandwich. I LOVE egg salad sandwiches. They are not the easiest sandwich to find in Las Vegas and especially on the Strip. A few years past, I really enjoyed the Johnny Rockets egg salad sandwich until they got rid of it. The egg salad sandwich is relatively inexpensive for the Las Vegas Strip where a Subway sandwich could cost over $8. I would never want to eat an egg salad sandwich by itself. I'd add a prepackaged potato salad for $1.50 and a fountain Pepsi for a couple of dollars more that came out to $13 and change. \n\n  Before I could enjoy the food I had to pay. This is a two line process. On line 1, I ordered and picked up the sandwich with the prepackaged potato salad and fountain Pepsi before bringing my tray to line 2 to pay. I carried the tray outside to the Greenwich Village Street where the tables are. \n\n  The egg salad sandwich brought back this loving feeling of enjoying delicious food in a New York deli. They served it on between two slices of rye bread (I could of had sourdough). Complimenting the overflowing egg salad that required a fork to savour every bite was onions, tomato, and lettuce. The potato salad was nothing extraordinary. Perhaps, the next time I visit I may enjoy the sandwich with hard to find Wise potato chips or go nearby upstairs to Coney Island to pick up Nathan's crinkley cut fries. \n\n   Sitting in the Greenwich Village Street amplified this New York state of mind that in reality is a New York - New York state of mind. The sights and sounds of the casino is exciting. Up above the runaway New York Express roller coaster taxi careened on the tracks, the Times Square Dueling Piano players rocked the classics across Greenwich Village. Greenberg's Deli with the New York - New York Greenwich Village is the marriage of a Las Vegas and New York deli dining experience that brings back a loving feeling that had been gone gone gone.", "stars": 4.0}, {"text": "All I saw were gorgeous women, the finest men, and top of the billboard DJ's.

I say \"second ever tattoo\" because my first, a heavy black equal sign on my calf, was done by a different artist in town and it healed so terribly and the line work was awful. After my first session with Jake was over, I trusted him enough to share my concerns with him about the first tattoo. We spent another hour together past his appointment time with me because he wouldn't let me leave without allowing him to fix the botched the equal sign. He sincerely wished to make me feel confident about that first tattoo and he did a wonderful job fixing it. \n\nSince then it's been Jake all the way. \n\nJake is the most patient, kindhearted and skilled artist I've ever had the pleasure of sharing time with. Of course I can't deny that he's my only artist but I've met plenty through the years. His attention to detail is brilliant and he has consistently impressed me with his line work and shading from year one to year 8. I am in no way artistically inclined so all of my tattoos have gone from ideas to reality with Jakes beautiful interpretations. I've always put my trust in him to make the best decisions for my designs, placement and colors without having to give up the freedom of meeting my specific desires. He is always receptive to changes and tweaks and never expresses frustration or judgement even after the millionth change. \n\nI've shared great conversations with Jake while in the chair and his bedside manner has always put me at ease. I've never questioned my safety during a session with him and I know I'm in control of the session should I want to end early or keep battling on. Through the easiest spots and the most painful of areas he's always encouraging and engaging through the process. \n\nI'm proud to recommend Jake to my family and friends", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "I had a great time here on sat!!!

At Chevy, the conversation was centered around how rich in women the car would make me (cleaned that up a bit for the review). And the Cadillac sales guy lacked confidence in the product that he was selling stating; \"you're not here if you're worried about safety; you're here for an image.\"\n\nAt this dealership I came back multiple times. Test drove different models, was shown everything I asked to see, and was never pressured. I of course had to negotiate for the best price. I paid what I expected. Ferri was my sales associate.

His goal and plans for serving healthy, wholesome food tailored to customers dietary needs is far ahead of the way present day restaurants are set up and his customized tiffin meals, I know for sure will be a success. Don't judge a book by its cover, the food here is excellent and fresh.

Service was a little wacky with many different waitresses and servers coming to our table but they were all cordial. \n\nThere is a sushi buffet for lunch, but they also have an option where you can get 2 rolls for $7 or 3 rolls for $9. It was so cheap that my expectations weren't very high but the sushi was definitely better than some fancier/more expensive rolls I've had in the past. They are small, but 2 is perfect if you aren't super hungry. I like how there isn't a super thick coating of rice around the fish, which happens at other buffet places.  I'd recommend the buffet if you have a large appetite or came with a large group of people. I also tried a spicy beef dish off the Chinese szichuan menu and it was very tender.

Terminex, Orkin, and House Doctors.\n\nFirst to show, House Doctors!  A gentleman named Chas showed up and walked through the entire home checking out termites.  The one bedroom is the only room that showed an active sign and his plan of attack was Termidor around the entire perimeter of the house.  He provided a price for a two and five year warranty and went on his way, no pressure at all.  \n\nNext to show was Terminex.  A gentleman named Joe showed up, much more professional than house doctors with his uniform, shoe covers, truck and all.  He walked around the whole house as-well and his treatment plan was Termidor ONLY in the area showing current activity, and then he would place bait stations around the perimeter around the house.  You think that would be cheaper?  Wrong.  Terminex rang up right at 2 grand after a 10% discount for a 5 year warranty.  Joe did not pressure me that hard however he did attempt to close the sale and said they could get started same day.  \n\nLastly, Orkin showed professional as well.  I forgot the gentleman's name but he did the most through check out of the tree (only person to check attic).  He had the exact same treatment plan as House Doctors.  Now for the sales pitch.  Talk about high pressure.  He sat me at my kitchen table and spent over an hour talking to me about how Orkin is the best.  Be ready with for for Orkin.  Orkin was the most expensive at $2100 with only a one year warranty.  \n\nNeedless to say we went with House Doctors.  Best most fair price, great people, and amazing service.
